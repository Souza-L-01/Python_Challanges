# Modules and Packages
# In programming, a module is a piece of software that has a specific functionality. For example, when building a ping pong game, one module may be responsible for the game logic, and another module draws the game on the screen. Each module consists of a different file, which may be edited separately.

# Writing modules
# Modules in Python are just Python files with a .py extension. The name of the module is the same as the file name. A Python module can have a set of functions, classes, or variables defined and implemented. The example above includes two files:

# mygame/

# mygame/game.py

# mygame/draw.py

# The Python script game.py implements the game. It uses the function draw_game from the file draw.py, or in other words, the draw module that implements the logic for drawing the game on the screen.

# Modules are imported from other modules using the import command. In this example, the game.py script may look something like this:
