# Classes and Objects
# Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

class MyClass:
    varible = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")
myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.varible
