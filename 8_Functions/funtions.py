# Functions
# What are Functions?
# Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks, allowing us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save some time. Also functions are a key way to define interfaces so programmers can share their code.

def my_function():
    print("Hello From My Function!")    

def my_function_with_args(username, greeting):
    print("Hello, %s, From my function! I wish you %s" % (username, greeting))

def sum_two_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
