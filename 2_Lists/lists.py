# Lists
# Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner. Here is an example of how to build a list.

mylist = []
mylist.append(1)
mylist.append(2)
mylist.append(3)
print(mylist[0]) # prints 1
print(mylist[1]) # prints 2
print(mylist[2]) # prints 3

# for loop will interate over each item in the list and print it out.
for x in mylist:
    print(x)

# Accessing an index which does not exist generates an exception (an error).

numbers = []
strings = []
names = ["John", "Eric", "Jessica"]

numbers.append(1)
numbers.append(2)
numbers.append(3)

strings.append("hello")
strings.append("world")

second_name = names[1]
print(numbers)
print(strings)
print("The second name on the names list is %s" % second_name)
